## Collapsible App Bar

An `<AppBar>` is an extension of the [MUI App Bar](https://mui.com/material-ui/api/app-bar/) that can expand and collapse as you scroll the page.

<AppBar />

## Permanently Collapsed

Setting the variant to `'collapsed'` will lock the App Bar at its collapsed size and it will behave like a default MUI App Bar.

<CollapsedAppBar />

## Permanently Expanded

Setting the variant to `'expanded'` will lock the App Bar at its expanded size.

<ExpandedAppBar />

## Adding Additional Content

You can organize the contents of your App Bar by adding a [Toolbar](https://mui.com/material-ui/api/toolbar/) component, just as you would with a MUI App Bar.

<AppBarWithAdditionalContent />
