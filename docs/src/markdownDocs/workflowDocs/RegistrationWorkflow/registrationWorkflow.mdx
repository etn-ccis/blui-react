# Registration Workflow Guide

The registration workflow includes screens related to user sign-up / registration including Create Account, Create Password, Account Details, etc.

## RegistrationContextProvider

The screens in this workflow access shared data / configuration / API definitions through a `RegistrationContextProvider` which should wrap all of the relevant routes / screens.

You must supply the `AuthContextProvider` with the following props / data:

- `actions`: defines the API calls / functions to execute when certain actions are performed in the UI (such as submitting the password form)
- `language`: configures the language displayed on the screens
- `navigate`: a function that can be called to navigate to a new route
- `routeConfig`: an object describing the URLs you are using for the relevant routes so the workflow can correctly navigate between screens

More information about the required and optional props can found in the [API](#api) section.

## Implement RegistrationUIActions

Because this workflow package is back-end agnostic, you must provide an implementation for what happens when the user triggers certain behaviors in the UI.

The example project includes a skeleton implementation of all required functions using mocks / sleeps. You will need to replace these implementations with appropriate calls to your APIs, caching the returned data, etc. depending on the requirements of your application.

1. Create a `RegistrationUIActions.ts` file
    - This file will handle the implementation of the registration related actions (such as create password, verify code, and create account).
    - You can copy this file directly from the [example](../example/src/actions/RegistrationUIActions.tsx) project as a starting point and then update the implementation details if you choose.
2. You might also want to copy over the `example/src/store` and `example/src/constants` folders, which provide a very basic mechanism for storing important data using LocalStorage
    - You will want to switch this out for a more secure approach before going to production with your application.

## Example Usage

Here is an example of how you would set up the Registration workflow using our recommended routing solution ([React Router](https://reactrouter.com/)).

The Registration Workflow is made available as a single-page, multi-step component â€” you will only need a single route for the workflow. If you wish to support invitation-based and self-registration, you can configure two separate routes and use the `RegistrationWorkflow` component to configure each flow separately.

<CodeBlock
    language={'jsx'}
    code={`<Routes>
    {/* Wrap all routes in a single shared RegistrationContextProvider */}
    <Route
        element={
            <RegistrationContextProvider actions={actions} language={'en'} navigate={navigate} routeConfig={{}}>
                <Outlet />
            </RegistrationContextProvider>
        }
    >
        {/* Routes for each workflow you want to include */}
        <Route path={'/self-registration'} element={<RegistrationWorkflow />} />
        <Route path={'/register-by-invite'} element={<RegistrationWorkflow isInviteRegistration />} />
    </Route>
    ...
</Routes>`}
/>

For a detailed explanation of setting up routes, see the [Routing](/workflows/routing/) guide.
