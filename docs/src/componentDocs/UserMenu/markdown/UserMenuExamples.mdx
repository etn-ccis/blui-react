## User Menu

The `<UserMenu>` is a combination of an avatar and a [MUI Menu](https://mui.com/api/menu/) that is used to hold user account-related information and actions. It is typically located in the top corner of your application within a toolbar.

<UserMenu />

## Alternative Avatar Formats

The User Menu supports multiple avatar formats (text, icon, image).

## Adding a Menu Header

You can add a header to the top of the menu by passing `menuTitle` and `menuSubtitle` props. The avatar will also appear in the menu header.

## Customizing the Menu

If you want to supply your own custom menu, you can pass in your own menu element via the `menu` prop.

<UserMenuWithCustomHeader />

## Using a Bottom Sheet

On larger screens the User Menu opens as a dropdown, but on smaller screens it opens as a bottomsheet. You can customize the point where this transition occurs via the `useBottomSheetAt` prop (default of 600px).
