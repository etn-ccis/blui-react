## Drawer Nav Item

A `<DrawerNavItem>` represents a single list item in the navigation drawer. Nav items can contain any combination of title, subtitle and icon.

## Selecting a Nav Item

Navigation items can be highlighted with an active state by setting the `activeItem` prop. The shape of the highlight can be either "square" (default) or "round".

## Nesting the Nav Items

Navigation items can be nested to allow for a multi-level navigation hierarchy. Similar to the [Drawer Nav Group](/components/drawer-nav-group/examples), you can do this by adding additional Nav Items as children or by specifying the nested structure via the `items` prop. Deep nesting can cause performance issues â€” we recommend limiting yourself to 2-3 levels when possible.
