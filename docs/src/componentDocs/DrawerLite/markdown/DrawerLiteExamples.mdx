## Drawer Lite

The `<DrawerLite>` component is a simplified version of the [Drawer](/components/drawer/examples) that provides navigation context for drawer child components without the full drawer functionality. It is always "open" and does not support collapsing or variants.

A common use case is for dynamic sub-navigation, where clicking a main navigation item displays a different set of sub-navigation options in the DrawerLite panel.
